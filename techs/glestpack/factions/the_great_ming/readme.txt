**The GREAT MING FACTION MOD FOR GLEST** By Mr War, 2012

===========ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS================
This mod would not have been possible with out the extensive and frequent help of many in the online GLEST community. I would particularly like to mention:

Will for so much technical help, suggestions and testing
Hagekura, whose Japanese Mod was an inspiration and a testing ground for my infant modding skills - plus many xml bits remain in my mod
Plus so many others unnamed

I also received great help and advice from China History Forum http://www.chinahistoryforum.com/index.php?
