Welcome=Welcome to the Moderate ZetaGlest Tutorial, here you will learn the some of the more advanced features of the game.
MagicBrief=You are in command of the Magic faction, which uses mages and summoned creatures to fight.
InitiateBrief=Initiates are the basic Magic unit, they can harvest resources and build structures.
InitiatePromotion=Initiates can be promoted to Battlemages, to do so, select an Initiate, and use the "Promote to Battlemage" command.
BattlemageBrief=Battlemages are the core Magic warriors, they have powerful ranged attacks and also good speed and resistance.
EnergyBrief=Magic units usually need Energy to be produced, Energy is not consumed like Food, but it is only required when the unit is created. It is produced by Energy Sources.
EnergyBrief2=Make sure you always have enough Energy to produce new units.
SummonedUnitsBrief=The other way the Magic faction produces units is by summoning them. You will need a Summoner for this, they are produced at the Summoners Guild.
SummonerBrief=Summoners can create several types of creatures, the most basic one is the Daemon.
DaemonBrief=Daemons are really weak but also very cheap, they are useful as basic melee warriors and are also good for scouting.
OtherSummonedCreatures=Summoners can create more advanced creatures, like Ghost Armors and Dragons, however they require that you research the right upgrades.
GhostArmorRequirements=Ghost Armors require the Ancient Summoning upgrade, that can be researched at the Summoners Guild.
GhostArmorBrief=Ghost Armors are a medium melee unit, useful to keep enemy warriors away from your Battlemages.
RitualBrief=Initiates have a second build command, called Ritual, used to build advanced structures and also powerful creatures like the Golem. You will need a Library to access them.
GolemBrief=Golems are very powerful defensive units, they have a powerful attack and very good resistance, but they can only move as long as they have enough energy points.
ArmyManagement=As you produce higher numbers of units, they might become difficult to manage.
DoubleClickBrief=By double clicking on a unit, you can select all the units of the same type in the surroundings.
GroupSelectBrief=You can define groups of units by selecting them and then pressing Control and a number key, then you can recall groups by pressing the number key again.
