# Contributing to the ZetaGlest data repository

Thank you your interest in this project!

This repo mainly holds data used by [ZetaGlest](https://zetaglest.github.io/docs/).

The guidelines for contributing are the same for the [ZetaGlest source
code](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source), and can be found
in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ZetaGlest/zetaglest-source/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
(link leads to a different repository in the [ZetaGlest
organization](https://github.com/ZetaGlest)). That document also
contains the instructions for performing pull requests.
